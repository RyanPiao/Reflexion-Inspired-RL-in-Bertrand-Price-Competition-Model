# Research Proposal: Reflexion-Inspired Reinforcement Learning in the Bertrand Price Competition Model

## Abstract
This research proposes adapting the Reflexion-inspired reinforcement learning model to the Bertrand price competition model. Unlike traditional approaches, this novel method will incorporate a structured cycle of action generation, market evaluation, and strategic reflection to explore competitive pricing dynamics and the potential for tacit collusion among firms.

## 1. Introduction
### Background
The Bertrand price competition model, crucial in understanding oligopolistic markets, assumes independent price-setting by firms. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios, including tacit collusion, is often overlooked.

### Rationale
Adapting the Reflexion algorithm from language processing to economic modeling offers a dynamic approach to simulate market behaviors. This method’s iterative process could lead to a deeper understanding of market dynamics and strategies.

### Research Objectives
- To develop a Reflexion-inspired RL model for the Bertrand competition scenario.
- To examine the strategic behavior of firms in response to market conditions.
- To evaluate the implications for market dynamics and economic theory.

- **Approach**: Agents learn through interaction with the environment, adjusting strategies based on rewards.
- **Key Contribution**: Contributed to understanding how AI agents might learn to collude tacitly in market settings.

### Reflexion-Inspired RL Model
- **Objective**: To simulate market dynamics, focusing on how firms adapt and reflect on pricing strategies.
- **Algorithm**: Involves action generation, evaluation, and reflection, learning from entire action trajectories.
