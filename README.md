# Research Proposal: Reflexion-Inspired Reinforcement Learning in the Bertrand Price Competition Model

## Abstract
This research proposes adapting the innovative Reflexion-inspired reinforcement learning model to the Bertrand price competition model. This approach will explore the dynamics of competitive pricing, focusing on strategic adaptation and the potential for tacit collusion among market firms.

## 1. Introduction
### Background
The Bertrand price competition model, crucial in understanding oligopolistic markets, assumes independent price-setting by firms. The Reflexion model, initially designed for language models, offers a new perspective with its unique structure of action, evaluation, and reflection.

### Rationale
Adapting the Reflexion model to economic modeling could provide a more dynamic and realistic simulation of market behaviors. This method’s iterative process may lead to deeper insights into competitive pricing and market dynamics.

### Research Objectives
- To apply a Reflexion-inspired RL model to the Bertrand competition scenario.
- To analyze the adaptive and reflective behaviors of firms in response to market conditions.
- To explore the implications for market dynamics, particularly focusing on competitiveness and collusion.

## 2. Literature Review
### Nicolas Lepore's 2021 Harvard Thesis
- **Objective**: Applying RL in the Bertrand model to explore tacit collusion among AI agents.
- **Algorithm**: Utilization of Q-learning, DQN, A3C, and PPO.
- **Approach**: Agents learn through direct interaction with the environment, adjusting strategies based on rewards.
- **Key Contribution**: Understanding AI-driven collusion in market settings.

### Reflexion-Inspired RL Model
- **Objective**:  This model aims to simulate market dynamics, with a focus on how firms might adapt and reflect on their pricing strategies in response to market feedback.
- **Algorithm**: The Reflexion-inspired approach involves a structured loop of action generation (price setting), evaluation (market response), and reflection (strategy adjustment). It emphasizes learning from entire action trajectories and incorporates off-policy learning methods.
- **Approach**: This model adds a significant reflection component to the learning process, where agents not only adjust based on rewards but also actively reflect on their actions and outcomes, potentially using complex evaluation models.
- **Key Contribution**: The Reflexion-inspired model could offer a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics and strategies, especially in scenarios where long-term strategy and complex interactions are crucial. It goes beyond immediate reward optimization, potentially leading to more innovative and adaptive market strategies.

### Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning
- **Foundation**: The paper introduces a novel RL approach for language processing, emphasizing verbal interactions and reinforcement.
- **Adaptation to Economics**: Translating its principles to economic modeling, particularly in how firms might dynamically adjust their strategies based on market feedback.
