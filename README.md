# Enhanced Research Proposal: Advanced Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms in Investigating Tacit Collusion in the Bertrand Price Competition Model

## Abstract
This research intends to investigate the dynamics of tacit collusion in the Bertrand price competition model using a diverse range of advanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and evolutionary algorithms. The study aims to explore how AI agents might evolve from competitive to cooperative strategies under various market conditions.

## 1. Introduction
### Background
The Bertrand price competition model, vital for understanding oligopolistic markets, often assumes independent price-setting by firms. However, real-world scenarios, including the possibility of tacit collusion, present a more complex situation.

### Rationale
Applying advanced RL and evolutionary algorithms provides a dynamic and exploratory approach to understand how AI agents might learn to tacitly collude, reflecting potential real-world market behaviors.

### Research Objectives
- To simulate the Bertrand competition model using sophisticated multi-agent RL techniques and evolutionary algorithms, focusing on tacit collusion.
- To analyze how AI agents transition from competitive to cooperative strategies.
- To assess the implications of these findings for market dynamics and policy considerations.

## 2. Literature Review
### Tacit Collusion in Oligopolistic Markets
- Studies on the phenomenon of tacit collusion in markets with a few dominant players, examining how firms might independently reach collusive equilibria.

### The Folk Theorem and Economic Models
- Literature applying the folk theorem in economic models, especially in oligopolistic competition, to understand sustained cooperation in repeated games.

### Advanced RL in Economic Decision-Making
- Progress in applying reinforcement learning in complex economic scenarios, including algorithms like Q-learning, DQN, A3C, PPO, and DDPG.
