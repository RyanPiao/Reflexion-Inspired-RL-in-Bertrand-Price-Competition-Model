# Reflexion-Inspired RL in Bertrand Price Competition Model

This repository explores an innovative adaptation of the Reflexion-inspired reinforcement learning (RL) model to the Bertrand price competition model. Contrasting with traditional RL methods, such as those in Nicolas Lepore's 2021 thesis, this project introduces a novel approach to deepen the understanding of tacit collusion and market dynamics in economic models.

## Key Features
- **Cyclical Process**: Implementation of a cyclical process encompassing action generation, market response evaluation, and outcome reflection to inform future strategic decisions.
- **Strategic Depth and Adaptability**: Enhancing the strategic depth and adaptability in economic modeling, a dimension not fully explored in traditional RL approaches.
- **Learning from Trajectories**: Emphasis on learning from entire action trajectories and conducting complex evaluations, offering a more holistic view of market behavior.
- **Long-Term Strategy Development**: Focused on providing insights into long-term strategy development and adaptability within the dynamic market environments of the Bertrand model.

## Project Background
Building upon the foundations laid in traditional economic modeling and RL, this project seeks to explore new frontiers by integrating advanced AI methodologies. It aims to contribute a fresh perspective to the study of competitive strategies and collusion scenarios within the Bertrand price competition framework.

## Objectives
- To investigate the potential of Reflexion-inspired RL in enhancing the understanding of market dynamics and strategic behaviors in the Bertrand price competition model.
- To compare and extend the findings of traditional RL approaches, specifically in the context of tacit collusion among market agents.
