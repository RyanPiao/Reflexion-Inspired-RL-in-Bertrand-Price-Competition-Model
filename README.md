# Research Proposal: Advanced Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms in Investigating Tacit Collusion in the Bertrand Price Competition Model

## Abstract
This research intends to investigate the dynamics of tacit collusion in the Bertrand price competition model using a diverse range of advanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and evolutionary algorithms. The study aims to explore how AI agents might evolve from competitive to cooperative strategies under various market conditions.

## 1. Introduction
### Background
The Bertrand price competition model, vital for understanding oligopolistic markets, often assumes independent price-setting by firms. However, real-world scenarios, including the possibility of tacit collusion, present a more complex situation.

### Rationale
Applying advanced RL and evolutionary algorithms provides a dynamic and exploratory approach to understand how AI agents might learn to tacitly collude, reflecting potential real-world market behaviors.

### Research Objectives
- To simulate the Bertrand competition model using sophisticated multi-agent RL techniques and evolutionary algorithms, focusing on tacit collusion.
- To analyze how AI agents transition from competitive to cooperative strategies.
- To assess the implications of these findings for market dynamics and policy considerations.

## 2. Literature Review
- Examining tacit collusion in oligopolistic markets.
- Analyzing the folk theorem in the context of repeated games and its economic implications.
- Reviewing advanced applications of RL and evolutionary algorithms in economic decision-making.

## 3. Methodology
### Model Design
- Simulating a market with `n` firms, each represented by an RL agent.
- Experimenting with different market conditions that influence collusion.

### RL Framework
- Employing algorithms like Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3), and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), and exploring their application in multi-agent environments.
- Analyzing both discrete and continuous action spaces to model different strategic behaviors.

### Evolutionary Algorithms
- Implementing Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to explore complex strategy optimization that traditional RL might not capture.
- Investigating the role of EAs in emergent collaborative behaviors in economic models.

### Simulation Environment
- Creating a robust environment to replicate intricate market interactions and conditions conducive to tacit collusion.
- Tracking metrics such as pricing strategies, market share, collusion indices, and efficiency.

### Data Collection and Analysis
- Analyzing data on pricing decisions, market conditions, and agent behaviors to identify collusion patterns.
- Using advanced data analysis techniques to interpret complex interactions and strategies.

## 4. Expected Challenges
- Modeling the nuanced aspects of tacit collusion.
- Ensuring the adaptability and robustness of algorithms in dynamic market conditions.
- Addressing computational and analytical challenges of complex models.

## 5. Contributions
- This research will contribute to the understanding of tacit collusion in AI-driven markets, leveraging cutting-edge RL and evolutionary techniques.
- It will provide insights for regulatory frameworks and economic theories concerning market competition and cooperation.
- The findings will serve as a benchmark for future research in AI and economic modeling.

## 6. Timeline and Milestones
- **Month 1-2**: Literature review, model design, and development of simulation environment.
- **Month 3-4**: Implementation of RL algorithms and evolutionary strategies, and running simulations.
- **Month 5-6**: Data analysis and drafting research findings.

## 7. Conclusion
This study aims to integrate advanced AI techniques with economic theories, providing new insights into market dynamics and strategic decision-making in competitive environments.
