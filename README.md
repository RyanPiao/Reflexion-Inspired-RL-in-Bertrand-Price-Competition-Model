# Research Proposal: Investigating Tacit Collusion in the Bertrand Price Competition Model through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract
This research proposes to explore the dynamics of tacit collusion in the Bertrand price competition model using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework. We aim to investigate how AI agents might shift from competitive to cooperative strategies (akin to the folk theorem's predictions), under various market conditions, using epsilon-soft and off-policy learning techniques.

## 1. Introduction
### Background
The Bertrand price competition model, a cornerstone in understanding oligopolistic markets, traditionally assumes independent price-setting by firms. However, real-world deviations, especially the possibility of tacit collusion, offer a more complex scenario.

### Rationale
Integrating RL in this context allows for a dynamic exploration of how AI agents might independently learn to collude tacitly, mirroring potential real-world market behaviors. This approach also provides insights into the transitions between competitive and cooperative strategies in market dynamics.

### Research Objectives
- To simulate the Bertrand competition model using multi-agent RL, focusing on the potential for tacit collusion.
- To analyze the conditions under which AI agents move from competitive to cooperative strategies.
- To evaluate the implications of these findings for understanding market dynamics and regulatory concerns.

## 2. Literature Review
The review will focus on:
- Studies addressing tacit collusion in oligopolistic markets.
- Research exploring the folk theorem in the context of repeated games and its implications in economic models.
- Existing literature on the application of RL in economic and strategic decision-making scenarios.

## 3. Methodology
### Model Design
- A market with `n` firms will be simulated, with each firm represented by an RL agent.
- The model will allow for various market conditions that might influence the propensity for tacit collusion.

### RL Framework
- Algorithms such as Q-learning will be adapted for a multi-agent context, with an emphasis on learning cooperative strategies.
- The epsilon-soft policy will provide a mechanism for exploring both competitive and cooperative behaviors.

### Simulation Environment
- The environment will replicate complex market interactions, allowing for changes in market conditions that could lead to tacit collusion.
- Key performance indicators will include price levels, market shares, collusion indices, and overall market efficiency.

### Data Collection and Analysis
- Data on pricing decisions, market conditions, and agent strategies will be analyzed to identify patterns indicative of tacit collusion.
- Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will be employed to interpret these patterns.

## 4. Expected Challenges
- Capturing the subtle nuances of tacit collusion in a simulated environment.
- Ensuring robustness in the learning algorithms to handle the complexity of shifting from competition to cooperation.
- Addressing computational and data analysis challenges due to the intricate nature of the model.

## 5. Significance and Impact
- This research could significantly advance our understanding of how tacit collusion can emerge in AI-driven markets.
- The findings might have profound implications for regulatory policies and economic theory regarding market competition and cooperation.
- The study could serve as a benchmark for future research in AI applications in economic modeling.

## 6. Timeline and Milestones
- **Month 1**: Literature review and model design.
- **Month 2**: Development of the simulation environment and RL framework.
- **Month 3**: Running simulations and initial data analysis.
- **Month 4**: In-depth data analysis and drafting of research findings.

## 7. Conclusion
This research aims to bridge the gap between traditional economic models and modern AI techniques, providing new perspectives on market dynamics and strategic decision-making in competitive environments.
