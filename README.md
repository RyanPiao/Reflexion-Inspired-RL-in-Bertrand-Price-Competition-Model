# Reflexion-Inspired RL in Bertrand Price Competition Model

This repository explores an innovative adaptation of the Reflexion-inspired reinforcement learning (RL) model to the Bertrand price competition model. This project takes a novel approach compared to traditional RL methods, aiming to deepen the understanding of tacit collusion and market dynamics in economic models.

## Key Features
- **Cyclical Process**: Implements a cyclical process of action generation, market response evaluation, and reflection on outcomes to inform future strategies.
- **Strategic Depth and Adaptability**: Adds strategic depth and adaptability, offering a new dimension to economic modeling.
- **Trajectory Learning and Complex Evaluation**: Focuses on learning from entire action trajectories and conducting complex evaluations of market responses.
- **Long-Term Strategy Development**: Provides insights into long-term strategy development in dynamic market environments.

## Project Background
Building on traditional economic modeling and RL, this project integrates advanced AI methodologies to explore new aspects of the Bertrand price competition model. It aims to offer fresh perspectives on competitive strategies and collusion scenarios.
