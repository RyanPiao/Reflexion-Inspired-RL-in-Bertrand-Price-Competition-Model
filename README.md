# Research Proposal: Advanced Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms in Investigating Tacit Collusion in the Bertrand Price Competition Model

## Abstract
This research intends to investigate the dynamics of tacit collusion in the Bertrand price competition model using a diverse range of advanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and evolutionary algorithms. The study aims to explore how AI agents might evolve from competitive to cooperative strategies under various market conditions.

## 1. Introduction
### Background
The Bertrand price competition model, vital for understanding oligopolistic markets, often assumes independent price-setting by firms. However, real-world scenarios, including the possibility of tacit collusion, present a more complex situation.

### Rationale
Applying advanced RL and evolutionary algorithms provides a dynamic and exploratory approach to understand how AI agents might learn to tacitly collude, reflecting potential real-world market behaviors.

### Research Objectives
- To simulate the Bertrand competition model using sophisticated multi-agent RL techniques and evolutionary algorithms, focusing on tacit collusion.
- To analyze how AI agents transition from competitive to cooperative strategies.
- To assess the implications of these findings for market dynamics and policy considerations.

## 2. Literature Review
### Tacit Collusion in Oligopolistic Markets
- Studies on the phenomenon of tacit collusion in markets with a few dominant players, examining how firms might independently reach collusive equilibria.

### The Folk Theorem and Economic Models
- Literature applying the folk theorem in economic models, especially in oligopolistic competition, to understand sustained cooperation in repeated games.

### Advanced RL in Economic Decision-Making
- Progress in applying reinforcement learning in complex economic scenarios, including algorithms like Q-learning, DQN, A3C, PPO, and DDPG.

### Calvano, E., et al. on AI and Collusion
Emilio Calvano and colleagues' paper, "Artificial intelligence, algorithmic pricing, and collusion" (2020), delves into the impact of AI and machine learning on market dynamics. They specifically focus on algorithmic pricing and potential collusion in digital markets. The study employs advanced machine learning algorithms to simulate various market scenarios, revealing how algorithmic strategies can evolve in ways that might facilitate tacit collusion among competing firms.

### Nicolas Lepore's Thesis on AI Pricing Collusion
Nicolas Lepore's thesis, "AI Pricing Collusion: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Bertrand Competition" (2021), presents an in-depth analysis using multi-agent RL algorithms to study the Bertrand competition model. Lepore's work primarily utilizes Q-learning, DQN (Deep Q-Network), and variants of actor-critic methods such as A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), exploring how these algorithms can model and potentially encourage tacit collusion among AI agents in simulated market environments.

This comprehensive literature review will establish a solid theoretical and empirical foundation for our research, highlighting the significance of advanced RL techniques and evolutionary algorithms in exploring tacit collusion in the Bertrand price competition model.

## 3. Methodology
### Model Design
- Simulating a market with `n` firms, each represented by an RL agent.
- Experimenting with different market conditions that influence collusion.

### RL Framework
- Employing algorithms like Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3), and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), and exploring their application in multi-agent environments.
- Analyzing both discrete and continuous action spaces to model different strategic behaviors.

### Evolutionary Algorithms
- Implementing Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to explore complex strategy optimization that traditional RL might not capture.
- Investigating the role of EAs in emergent collaborative behaviors in economic models.

### Simulation Environment
- Creating a robust environment to replicate intricate market interactions and conditions conducive to tacit collusion.
- Tracking metrics such as pricing strategies, market share, collusion indices, and efficiency.

### Data Collection and Analysis
- Analyzing data on pricing decisions, market conditions, and agent behaviors to identify collusion patterns.
- Using advanced data analysis techniques to interpret complex interactions and strategies.
